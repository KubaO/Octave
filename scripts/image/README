Release 0.0 of the octave image processing toolbox.

========================================================================

To install:

1) Copy all of the m-files to a directory that is in octave's LOADPATH.

2) Compile octtopnm.c (Either "sh octtopnm.c" *or* "make octtopnm" *or*
   "cc -o octtopnm octtopnm.c" do the job for me)

3) Copy octtopnm and default.img to some directory.

4) Before calling any of the routines from octave, make sure that the
   octave *global* variable IMAGEDIR contains the name of the directory
   in step 3)

A specific installation example:

My HOME directory is /mpl/amr.  I have all the m-files, octtopnm and
default.img stored in directory /mpl/amr/Apps/octave/image.  My
.octaverc file contains the following lines:

LOADPATH=[LOADPATH,":/mpl/amr/Apps/octave/image"];
global IMAGEDIR="/mpl/amr/Apps/octave/image";

========================================================================

Notes:

1) One of the programs "xv" or "xloadimage" must be in your PATH.
   If you don't have either of these installed, I recommend
   downloading and installing xv.  (Try export.lcs.mit.edu or
   mirror sites for source.)

2) For a quick test of the major features try:

     image;                # An "Easter egg" containing my favorite image.
     imagesc(eye(40));     # Auto matrix scaling test.
     colormap(ocean);      # Change to a color colormap.
     imagesc(rand(50));    # A color image.

3) Octave won't "quit"  (for me anyway) until I've killed all of the image
   windows.

Good luck!
