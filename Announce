Subject: ANNOUNCE: Octave Version 2.0 released

Octave version 2.0 is now available for ftp from ftp.che.wisc.edu
in the directory /pub/octave.  Diffs from the previous release are not
available because they would be quite large.

This is a major new release and includes many new features.
User-visible changes since the last release are listed in the file
NEWS, which is included in the distribution and available from
ftp.che.wisc.edu in the file /pub/octave/NEWS.  The ChangeLog files in
the source distribution contain a more detailed record of changes
made since the last release.

Most bugs reported since the release of version 1.1.1 have been fixed.
You can help make Octave more reliable by reporting any bugs you find
to bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.

What is Octave?
---------------

Octave is a high-level interactive language, primarily intended for
numerical computations that is mostly compatible with Matlab.

Octave can do arithmetic for real and complex scalars and matrices,
solve sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, integrate functions over
finite and infinite intervals, and integrate systems of ordinary
differential and differential-algebraic equations.

Octave uses the GNU readline library to handle reading and editing
input.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to the
cursor movement commands used by GNU Emacs, and a vi-style line
editing interface is also available.  At the end of each session, the
command history is saved, so that commands entered during previous
sessions are not lost.

The Octave distribution includes a 200+ page Texinfo manual.  Access
to the complete text of the manual is available via the help command
at the Octave prompt.

Two and three dimensional plotting is fully supported using gnuplot.

The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard Fortran ones
like Lapack, Odepack, Dassl, the Blas, etc., packaged in a library
of C++ classes.  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled
with the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
functions.  If that's not possible, you can still compile Octave if
you have the free Fortran to C translator f2c.

Octave is also free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation.
