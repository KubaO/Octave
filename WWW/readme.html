<title> Octave -- a high-level language for numerical computations </title>
</head>

<h3>Copyright (C) 1996 John W. Eaton</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.
</p>

<p>
Octave is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option) any
later version.
</p>

<p>
Octave is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the file COPYING for more
details.
</p>

<h4>Availability</h4>
<p>
The latest released version of Octave is always available via
anonymous ftp from <a href="ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave">
ftp.che.wisc.edu</a> in the directory /pub/octave.
Complete source and binaries for several popular systems are
available.
</p>

<h4>Installation and Bugs</h4>
<p>
Octave requires approximately 25MB of disk storage to unpack and
install (significantly 	less if you don't compile with debugging
symbols).  In order to build Octave, you will need a current version
of g++, libg++, and GNU make.  Octave is known to compile on the
following systems:
</p>

<ul>
<li>SPARCstation 2 SunOS 4.1.2</li>
<li>IBM RS/6000 AIX 3.2.x</li>
<li>DECstation 5000/240 Ultrix 4.2a</li>
<li>i486 Linux</li>
<li>i486 NetBSD (without IEEE floating point support)</li>
<li>HP 9000/7xx HP-UX 9.x</li>
<li>SGI Irix 4.04</li>
<li>NeXT NeXTStep ?</li>
</ul>

<p>
See the notes in the files INSTALL and INSTALL.OCTAVE for more
specific installation instructions, including directions for
installing Octave from a binary distribution.
</p>

<p>
The file BUGS contains a recommended procedure for reporting bugs, as
well as a list of known problems.
</p>

<h4>Binary Distributions</h4>
<p>
Binary copies of Octave are now distributed for several popular Unix
systems.  To save disk space, the complete source code for Octave is
no longer included with the binary distribution, but should be
available in the same place as the binaries.  If not, please contact
bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
</p>

<p>
The file INSTALL.OCTAVE contains specific installation instructions,
for installing Octave from a binary distribution.
</p>

<h4>Implemenation</h4>
<p>
Octave is being developed with the Free Software Foundation's make,
bison (a replacement for YACC), flex (a replacement for lex), gcc/g++,
and libg++ on a SPARCstation II and a DECstation 5000/240.  It should
be possible to install it on any machine that runs GCC/G++.  It may
also be possible to install it using other implementations of these
tools, but it will most certainly require much more work.  Do yourself
a favor and get the GNU development tools, either via anonymous ftp
from prep.ai.mit.edu or by writing the Free Software Foundation, 675
Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
</p>

<p>
The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard Fortran ones
like Lapack, Linpack, Odepack, the Blas, etc., packaged in a library
of C++ classes (see the files in the libcruft and liboctave
subdirectories).  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled
with the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
functions.  If that's not possible, they are translated with f2c and
compiled with a C compiler.  Better performance is usually achieved if
the intermediate translation to C is avoided.
</p>

<p>
The library of C++ classes may also be useful by itself.
